```

## Data

This is what the data looks like after it has been cleaned. Using the "DT" package the data can be sifted and searched in this table

```{r}
#| echo: false
datatable(data)
```

### Add Boolean "remote" Column and Account for Hydrogeologists

Hydrogeologists make up a portion of total Geologist Jobs. If the job title in the Geology Jobs contains the word "hydrogeologist", the "job" column will be changed from "geologist" to "hydrogeologist" to compare the difference between these professions in the field of Hydrogeology.

```{r}
# Split into two data.tables for individual analysis
analyst <- data[job == "Data Analyst"]
geologist <- data[job == "Geologist"]

# if the title contains the word "hydrogeologist", change the job column to "hydrogeologist"
geologist <- geologist[, job := ifelse(title %like% "hydrogeologist" | title %like% "Hydrogeologist", "Hydrogeologist", job)]
```

### Data Summary

```{r}
#| echo: false
kable(summary(data))
```

### Missing Values Distribution

Most companies on indeed don not provide pay information. In fact, we are only 32.52 jobs provide information regarding pay.

Many employees rate their companies however. Only 32% of companies do not have ratings

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| warning: false
analyst_miss <- vis_miss(analyst) +
  labs(title = "Data Analyst")
geologist_miss <- vis_miss(geologist) +
  labs(title = "Geologist")

plot_grid(analyst_miss, geologist_miss)
```

## Pay Distribution

::: panel-tabset
### All Jobs

```{r}
#| code-fold: true

# remove values below $20000 (values that fall within the $100-$20000 must be contract poitions and were not accoutned for when cleaing)
pay_distribution <- data[pay > 20000]

ggplot(pay_distribution, aes(job, pay)) +
  geom_violin(aes(color=job)) +
  geom_beeswarm(aes(color=job)) +
  labs(title = "Pay Distribution Between Data Analyst and Geology Jobs",
       y = "Yearly Salary (CAD)")
```

### Data Analyst

```{r}
#| code-fold: true
pay_distribution_analyst <- analyst[pay > 20000]

ggplot(pay_distribution_analyst, aes(remote, pay)) +
  geom_violin(aes(color=remote)) +
  geom_beeswarm(aes(color =remote)) +
  labs(title = "Pay Distribution Between Remote and Non-Remote Data Analyst Jobs",
       y = "Yearly Salary (CAD)")
```

### Geologist

```{r}
#| code-fold: true
pay_distribution_geologist <- geologist[pay > 20000]

ggplot(pay_distribution_geologist, aes(job, pay)) +
  geom_violin(aes(color=job)) +
  geom_beeswarm(aes(color =job)) +
  labs(title = "Pay Distribution Between Geologists and Hydrogeologists",
       y = "Yearly Salary (CAD)")
```

### Pay Distribuation by City

The pay distribution divided based on location including remote jobs. Cities with less than 2 or fewer job postings have been removed from the data. This plot is interactive so the cities can be selected and viewed individually.

```{r}
#| code-fold: true
#| warning: false
# remove all cities with less than two entries to clean up box plot
cities_analyst <- pay_distribution_analyst[with(pay_distribution_analyst, location %in% names(which(table(location)>=5))), ]

ggplotly(ggplot(cities_analyst, aes(location, pay)) +
  geom_boxplot(aes(color=location)) +
  labs(title = "Pay Distribution Between Remote and Non-Remote Jobs",
       y = "Yearly Salary (CAD)"))
```

```{r}
#| code-fold: true
#| warning: false
# remove all cities with less than two entries to clean up box plot

ggplotly(ggplot(geologist, aes(province, pay)) +
  geom_boxplot(aes(color=province)) +
  labs(title = "Pay Distribution Between Remote and Non-Remote Jobs",
       y = "Yearly Salary (CAD)"))
```

This plot is not very informative due to the lack of information. For Geologist jobs, it may be more beneficial to look at the number of jobs in each city. Geology jobs are less likely to be remote and more dependant on where an individual actually wants to live

### Number of Geologist Jobs Per City

```{r}
#| code-fold: true
#| warning: false
# remove all cities with less than two entries to clean up box plot
ggplotly(ggplot(geologist, aes(fct_infreq(location))) +
  geom_bar(aes(color=location)) +
  labs(title = "Number of Geology Jobs Per City",
       y = "Yearly Salary (CAD)",
       x = "Location by") +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_blank(),
        legend.position = "bottom"))
```

## Rating Distribution

### All Jobs

```{r}
#| warning: false
#| code-fold: true
ratings <- data[!is.na(rating)]

ggplot(ratings, aes(job, rating)) +
  geom_violin(aes(color=job)) +
  geom_jitter(aes(color=job)) +
  labs(title = "Rating Distribution Between Remote and Non-Remote Jobs",
       y = "Yearly Salary (CAD)")
```

### Data Analyst

#| warning: false
#| code-fold: true
ratings_analyst <- analyst[!is.na(rating)]

ggplot(ratings_analyst, aes(remote, rating)) +
  geom_violin(aes(color=remote)) +
  geom_jitter(aes(color=remote)) +
  labs(title = "Rating Distribution Between Remote and Non-Remote Jobs",
       y = "Yearly Salary (CAD)")
```

### Geologist

```{r}
#| warning: false
#| code-fold: true

ggplot(ratings_geologist, aes(job, rating)) +

  geom_jitter(aes(color=job)) +
  labs(title = "Rating Distribution Between Remote and Non-Remote Jobs",
