<p>Most of the columns scraped here are in good condition to start using. However, the pay column is currently in string format, and contains additional strings as well as ranges of salaries. The strings will need to be parsed and the numeric values extracted. To deal with salary ranges, the average of the range will be taken so we can represent pay as a single number</p>

<p>Many data analyst positions are remote. Many of the listings still contain the city where the company is based with the word “remote” somewhere in the location such as “Remote in Toronto, ON”. If we want to analyze this data based on whether positions are remote or not, it would be nice if the location column was categorical and every position with remote in the title could be grouped into one. Therefor, if a column contains “remote” or “Remote”, the string will be changed to “remote” in the location column.</p>
